## Aims of the conference

<hr class="small">
{{< /rawhtml >}}

A large number of organizations that carry out, fund, and evaluate research have signed the Barcelona Declaration. These organizations have committed (1) to make openness the default for the research information they use and produce, (2) to work with services and systems that support and enable open research information, (3) to support the sustainability of infrastructures for open research information, and (4) to support collective action to accelerate the transition to openness of research information.

To support signatories of the Barcelona Declaration in fulfilling their commitment to open research information, the Paris Conference on Open Research Information has two aims:

* To provide a forum for sharing experiences and good practices regarding open research information.

* To develop a joint roadmap for open research information.
