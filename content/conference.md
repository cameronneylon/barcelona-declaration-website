## Aims of the conference

{{< /rawhtml >}}

A large number of organizations that carry out, fund, and evaluate research have signed the Barcelona Declaration. These organizations have committed (1) to make openness the default for the research information they use and produce, (2) to work with services and systems that support and enable open research information, (3) to support the sustainability of infrastructures for open research information, and (4) to support collective action to accelerate the transition to openness of research information.

To support signatories of the Barcelona Declaration in fulfilling their commitment to open research information, the Paris Conference on Open Research Information has two aims:

* To provide a forum for sharing experiences and good practices regarding open research information.

* To develop a joint roadmap for open research information.

Over two days in Paris and with a highly engaged group of online participants from a range of geographies we heard across multiple organizations how the Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information is being implemented. From funders, to institutions, governments and community organizations the commitment to act was striking.

The first day was an exciting, and rapid update from many organizations and on the second day we moved to mapping the future. At the end of the day we had a draft roadmap with concrete actions. Some of these were ambitious and long term. Many were already in progress. And all were concrete and specific, with goals, actors and time frames specified.

A big thank you to the many organizations that took part, both in the room in Paris and online. You brought a huge level of energy and enthusiasm to the challenges and opportunities that lie before us. We look forward to working together towards a future where Open Research Information is the norm!
