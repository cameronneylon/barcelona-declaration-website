In September of 2024 signatories, supporters and parties interested in the Barcelona Declaration met at Sorbonne University in Paris to discuss next steps in taking the agenda of the Declaration forward. 

In a two day hybrid in-person and online meeting, participants shared progress and challenges of advancing the production, management and use of open research information, and worked together to prioritize concrete actions that will make up a shared road map.

At the meeting, concrete actions were formulated and prioritized on the topics
* Journal article metadata
* Metadata for research outputs in institutional repositories,   
preprint repositories and data repositories
* Funding metadata
* Replacing closed systems for research information
* Sustainability of infrastructures
* Evaluating open data
* Evidence of benefits of open research information


Following the meeting, a theory of change framework was applied dividing actions into four categories (information gathering, frameworks & analysis, principles & guidelines and implementation & monitoring). 

The result is a concrete roadmap for coordinated activities. We invite organizations to get involved in the working groups that will take forward the actions on the roadmap.

The [conference report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14054244) describing the actions, roadmap and next steps (including coordination and support) is available on Zenodo.
