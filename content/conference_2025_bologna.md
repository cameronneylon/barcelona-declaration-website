## The Workshop

<hr class="small">
{{< /rawhtml >}}

The first day of the meeting will be dedicated to the **Bologna Meeting on Open Research Information**. It aims to encourage discussion between the signatories and supporters of the Barcelona Declaration and other interested participants. 

The second day of the meeting will be dedicated to *invited contributions, presentations and a poster session** on the topic of open scholarly metadata (comparable to previous editions of WOOC).

The day dedicated to the Barcelona Declaration will have a workshop-like character and will be focused on the [actions in the roadmap](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14054244) that were collectively put together during the [Paris Conference on Open Research Information](/conference_2024_paris). It will also be an opportunity for the working groups that are currently being set up to present their plans and discuss these with other participants.

Participation in both days of WOOC2025 is open to everyone. The aim is to welcome the signatories and supporters of the Barcelona Declaration, and anyone interested in open research information, in an interactive event that aspires to encourage the incubation of ideas to strategically orient the development of open research information practices.
