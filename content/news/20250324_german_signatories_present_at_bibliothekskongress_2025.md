Are you interested in discussing the role of libraries in the Barcelona Declaration? The German signatories look forward to meeting you in Bremen at the largest library convention in Germany.

A group of German-speaking signatories of the Barcelona Declaration have coordinated to submit presentations on the respective activities of their institutions. The organisers have created two complete sessions (“On the way to Barcelona” [1](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/sessions/204) and [2](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/sessions/203)), and there will be an [additional presentation about open metadata](https://bid2025.abstractserver.com/program/#/details/presentations/540) in a session on transformative agreements.

The [9th Bibliothekskongress](https://2025.bid-kongress.de/?lang=en), at the same time the 113th Bibliocon, is the largest library convention in the German-speaking world and has been held annually in different cities since 1900. The main topics are the role of libraries as promoters of science and research, as a place of democracy and as promoters of digital transformation and guarantors of reliable information.  

The 2025 edition will take place under the motto ‘#BibliothekenEntschlossenDemokratisch’ (#LibrariesDecidedlyDemocratic) in Bremen, 24 - 27 June.
