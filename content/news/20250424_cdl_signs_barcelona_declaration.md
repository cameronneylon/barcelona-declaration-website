Over the last two months, we’ve been happy to welcome several new Barcelona Declaration signatories, representing various types of organizations involved in performing and funding research. These include [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/) in the UK, [‘la Caixa’ Foundation](https://lacaixafoundation.org/en/) and
[CaixaResearch Institute](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/es/caixaresearch-institute) in Spain, [Deutsche Initiative für Netzwerkinformation e. V. (DINI)](https://dini.de/dini/ueber-uns) in Germany and [The Netherlands Association of Universities of Applied Sciences](https://www.vereniginghogescholen.nl/english). 

Today, we are excited to announce an important new signatory, [California Digital Library (CDL)](https://cdlib.org), representing the first research performing organization from the United States to sign the Barcelona Declaration. Through signing the Declaration, CDL is committing to supporting and participating in open, transparent and community-governed research information systems.

In their [public statement](https://cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2025/04/23/cdl-public-statement-on-endorsing-the-barcelona-declaration/), CDL outlines what signing the Declaration means for them in practice. This includes: prioritizing open systems, transparency in operations and partnerships, global collaboration as well as local empowerment, broadening participation and ongoing evaluation. As part of this process, CDL articulated [how the Declaration fits within their mission](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2025/04/advancing-open-research-information-at-cdl/) and published an [internal inventory](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/34m053gb) of how, as an organization, CDL currently manages and interacts with research information systems across their services.

We are looking forward to collaborating with CDL in these efforts, also in the context of the Barcelona Declaration working groups.  

Several organizations based in the United States are actively participating in ongoing developments around the Barcelona Declaration, even though they have not yet formally signed the Declaration. We hope that CDL joining the Barcelona Declaration as a signatory will help in broadening the reach of the Declaration among research performing organizations in the United States, accelerating the transition to open research information.
