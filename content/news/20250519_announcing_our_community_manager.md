Bárbara is based in Santiago, Chile. For the past 10 years, she has been part of the Open community, actively advocating for Open Access and Open Science. During this time, she has gained experience across different parts of the research ecosystem — working in research centers, universities, university libraries, and at ANID (Chile’s national research funding agency). Most recently, she supported Open Access journals as part of the SciELO Chile team.

*"Throughout my career, I’ve believed that meaningful change happens more easily when communities are engaged—and I truly enjoy helping make that happen. Being part of the Open community has shaped my professional journey, and now, as community manager for the Barcelona Declaration, I have the opportunity to put that belief into practice on a global scale. I'm excited and honored to contribute to this initiative and bring my values to life through this work."*


Please join us in welcoming Bárbara to the Barcelona Declaration team!
