We are excited to share the [Report of the Bologna Meeting on Open Research Information](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15730917), now available on Zenodo. The report captures key outcomes from the event held on May 28, 2025, in the context of the [5th Workshop on Open Citations and Open Scholarly Metadata (WOOC2025)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15730917). It highlights progress, priorities, and next steps across the Barcelona Declarationâ€™s [working groups](/working_groups).

Nearly 200 participants from 35 countries joined us (both in the room and online) to reflect on implementation efforts, explore future directions, and continue shaping the shared [roadmap](/roadmap) of the Barcelona Declaration.
