We are excited to announce the launch of the [Barcelona Declaration YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BarcelonaDeclaration): a new space to showcase the work of our growing community.

We are kicking things off with the **morning session of the Bologna Meeting**, held in May 2025, now available to watch in full. In this video, you’ll find:


* A warm welcome from **Silvio Peroni** (Open Citations and University of Bologna) and **Raffaella Campaner** (University of Bologna)

* A powerful update from our Executive Director, **Bianca Kramer**, on where we are and where we’re headed

* Implementation journeys from signatories working in diverse contexts: **Carla Carbonell** (Fundación “la Caixa”), **John Chodacki** (California Digital Library), and **Ana Ranitovic** (University of Groningen and the Dutch signatories of the Barcelona Declaration).

This is just the beginning. The channel will feature **Working Group updates, community stories**, and other content to support shared learning and global participation.

We hope this new channel becomes a helpful resource and a space to stay connected with one another. Watch the session and **subscribe**!
