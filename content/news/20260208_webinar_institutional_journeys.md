On 4 December 2025, the Barcelona Declaration, through its Working Group 4 (Replacing Closed Systems), co-organised the webinar **“Open Research Information in Action: Institutional Journeys Towards Open Systems”** together with the Helmholtz Open Science Office.

The session brought together **168 participants** from different regions and institutional contexts to explore how organisations are moving, gradually and pragmatically, away from closed, proprietary systems towards open research information.

Across the presentations and discussion, one shared understanding emerged clearly: **this transition is a process, not a revolution**. As Paola Galimberti (University of Milan) reflected, *“change is a slow process that must be accompanied by constant and appropriate support and training.”*

This perspective was echoed in reflections on implementation and sustainability. Drawing on the Leibniz Association’s CRIS initiative, Matthias Goeritz emphasized that *“community building and the development of competencies are of utmost importance for sustainable and long-term improvements.”*

### Learning from institutional journeys

Speakers shared concrete experiences from Europe and Latin America, reflecting on why they engaged with the Barcelona Declaration, how they are replacing or complementing closed systems, and what this looks like in day-to-day practice: from governance and infrastructure to decision-making and assessment.

The webinar featured the following institutional perspectives:

- **Matthias Goeritz** (Leibniz Association, Germany)
- **Paola Galimberti** (University of Milan, Italy)
- **Gabriel Vélez Cuartas** (Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia)
- **Joeri Both** (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands)

Moderated by:

- **Ignasi Labastida** (University of Barcelona, Spain)

Together, these cases illustrated that there is no single path to openness. Institutions start from different points and advance through iterative, collaborative steps, gradually reducing dependence on proprietary systems while developing trusted open infrastructures.

### Shared themes from the discussion

Rather than focusing on ideal models, the conversation centred on lived practice and collective learning. Topics included:

- Why open research information matters for fair assessment and informed decision-making
- How institutions are replacing closed systems with open infrastructures
- The role of open-source CRIS, dashboards, and data integration
- Why community-building and long-term support are essential for sustainable change
