### Overview

Organized in the context of the Barcelona Declaration and hosted by Working Group 5 (Sustaining Infrastructures), this session brings together leading open infrastructure organisations to discuss how the updated [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/) (POSI v2) are being applied, interpreted, and refined in practice. 

Speakers will reflect on how the principles support governance, funding, and long-term resilience, and what their adoption reveals about sustaining open infrastructure over time. These perspectives offer practical insights for institutions, funders, and service providers working to strengthen the sustainability of open research information systems.
