At the [Paris Conference on Open Research Information](/conference_2024_paris) in September 2024, signatories and supporters of the Barcelona Declaration formulated and prioritized concrete actions on the following topics:
* Journal article metadata
* Metadata for research outputs in institutional repositories,   
preprint repositories and data repositories
* Funding metadata
* Replacing closed systems for research information
* Sustainability of infrastructures
* Evaluating open data
* Evidence of benefits of open research information. 

Following the meeting, a theory of change framework was applied dividing actions into four categories (information gathering, frameworks & analysis, principles & guidelines and implementation & monitoring).

The result is a concrete road map for coordinated activities. We invite organizations to get involved in the working groups that will take forward the actions on the roadmap.

The complete [road map](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14054244) is available on Zenodo as part of the Paris Conference report.

We are currently setting up seven working groups, each coordinated by signatory organizations of the Barcelona Declaration, to work on the collective actions in the road map.

We have received over 100 expression of interest for working groups - it is great to see the involvement of the community on the topic of open research information! 
We aim to have working groups populated and starting active work in early 2025.
